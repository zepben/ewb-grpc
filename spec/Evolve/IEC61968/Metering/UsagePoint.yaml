name: UsagePoint
description: Logical or physical point in the network to which readings or events may be attributed. Used at the place where
  a physical or virtual meter may be located; however, it is not required that a meter be present.
attributes:
- name: isVirtual
  type: Boolean
  description: If true, this usage point is virtual, i.e., no physical location exists in the network where a meter could
    be located to collect the meter readings. For example, one may define a virtual usage point to serve as an aggregation
    of usage for all of a company's premises distributed widely across the distribution territory. Otherwise, the usage point
    is physical, i.e., there is a logical point in the network where a meter could be located to collect meter readings.
- name: connectionCategory
  type: String
  description: A code used to specify the connection category, e.g., low voltage or low pressure, where the usage point is
    defined.
- name: ratedPower
  type: Integer
  description: Active power that this usage point is configured to deliver in watts.
- name: approvedInverterCapacity
  type: Integer
  description: The approved inverter capacity at this UsagePoint in volt-amperes.
