name: RegulatingControl
description: "Specifies a set of equipment that works together to control a power system quantity such as voltage or flow.\
  \ \nRemote bus voltage control is possible by specifying the controlled terminal located at some place remote from the controlling\
  \ equipment.\nThe specified terminal shall be associated with the connectivity node of the controlled point.  The most specific\
  \ subtype of RegulatingControl shall be used in case such equipment participate in the control, e.g. TapChangerControl for\
  \ tap changers.\nFor flow control, load sign convention is used, i.e. positive sign means flow out from a TopologicalNode\
  \ (bus) into the conducting equipment.\nThe attribute minAllowedTargetValue and maxAllowedTargetValue are required in the\
  \ following cases:\n- For a power generating module operated in power factor control mode to specify maximum and minimum\
  \ power factor values;\n- Whenever it is necessary to have an off center target voltage for the tap changer regulator. For\
  \ instance, due to long cables to off shore wind farms and the need to have a simpler setup at the off shore transformer\
  \ platform, the voltage is controlled from the land at the connection point for the off shore wind farm. Since there usually\
  \ is a voltage rise along the cable, there is typical and overvoltage of up 3-4 kV compared to the on shore station. Thus\
  \ in normal operation the tap changer on the on shore station is operated with a target set point, which is in the lower\
  \ parts of the dead band.\nThe attributes minAllowedTargetValue and maxAllowedTargetValue are not related to the attribute\
  \ targetDeadband and thus they are not treated as an alternative of the targetDeadband. They are needed due to limitations\
  \ in the local substation controller. The attribute targetDeadband is used to prevent the power flow from move the tap position\
  \ in circles (hunting) that is to be used regardless of the attributes minAllowedTargetValue and maxAllowedTargetValue."
attributes:
- name: discrete
  type: Boolean
  description: The regulation is performed in a discrete mode. This applies to equipment with discrete controls, e.g. tap
    changers and shunt compensators.
- name: mode
  type: RegulatingControlModeKind
  description: The regulating control mode presently available.  This specification allows for determining the kind of regulation
    without need for obtaining the units from a schedule.
- name: monitoredPhase
  type: PhaseCode
  description: Phase voltage controlling this regulator, measured at regulator location.
- name: targetDeadband
  type: Float
  description: |-
    This is a deadband used with discrete control to avoid excessive update of controls like tap changers and shunt compensator banks while regulating.  The units of those appropriate for the mode. The attribute shall be a positive value or zero. If RegulatingControl.discrete is set to "false", the RegulatingControl.targetDeadband is to be ignored.
    Note that for instance, if the targetValue is 100 kV and the targetDeadband is 2 kV the range is from 99 to 101 kV.
- name: targetValue
  type: Float
  description: The target value specified for case input.   This value can be used for the target value without the use of
    schedules. The value has the units appropriate to the mode attribute.
- name: enabled
  type: Boolean
  description: The flag tells if regulation is enabled.
- name: maxAllowedTargetValue
  type: Float
  description: Maximum allowed target value (RegulatingControl.targetValue).
- name: minAllowedTargetValue
  type: Float
  description: Minimum allowed target value (RegulatingControl.targetValue).
- name: ratedCurrent
  type: Float
  description: The rated current of associated CT in amps for this RegulatingControl. Forms the base used to convert Line Drop
    Compensation settings from ohms to voltage.

  targetName: Terminal
  targetDescription: The terminal associated with this regulating control.  The terminal is associated instead of a node,
    since the terminal could connect into either a topological node or a connectivity node.  Sometimes it is useful to model
    regulation at a terminal of a bus bar object.
