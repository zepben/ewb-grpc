name: RatioTapChanger
description: |-
  A tap changer that changes the voltage ratio impacting the voltage magnitude but not the phase angle across the transformer.

  Angle sign convention (general): Positive value indicates a positive phase shift from the winding where the tap is located to the other winding (for a two-winding transformer).
attributes:
- name: stepVoltageIncrement
  type: PerCent
  description: |-
    Tap step increment, in per cent of rated voltage of the power transformer end, per step position.
    When the increment is negative, the voltage decreases when the tap step increases.
