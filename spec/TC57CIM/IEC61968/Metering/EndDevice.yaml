name: EndDevice
description: |-
  Asset container that performs one or more end device functions. One type of end device is a meter which can perform metering, load management, connect/disconnect, accounting functions, etc. Some end devices, such as ones monitoring and controlling air conditioners, refrigerators, pool pumps may be connected to a meter. All end devices may have communication capability defined by the associated communication function(s). An end device may be owned by a consumer, a service provider, utility or otherwise.
  There may be a related end device function that identifies a sensor or control point within a metering application or communications systems (e.g., water, gas, electricity).
  Some devices may use an optical port that conforms to the ANSI C12.18 standard for communications.
