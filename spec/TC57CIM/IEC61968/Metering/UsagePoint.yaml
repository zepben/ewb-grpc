name: UsagePoint
description: Logical or physical point in the network to which readings or events may be attributed. Used at the place where
  a physical or virtual meter may be located; however, it is not required that a meter be present.
attributes:
- name: amiBillingReady
  type: AmiBillingReadyKind
  description: Tracks the lifecycle of the metering installation at a usage point with respect to readiness for billing via
    advanced metering infrastructure reads.
- name: checkBilling
  type: Boolean
  description: True if as a result of an inspection or otherwise, there is a reason to suspect that a previous billing may
    have been performed with erroneous data. Value should be reset once this potential discrepancy has been resolved.
- name: connectionCategory
  type: String
  description: A code used to specify the connection category, e.g., low voltage or low pressure, where the usage point is
    defined.
- name: connectionState
  type: UsagePointConnectedKind
  description: State of the usage point with respect to connection to the network.
- name: disconnectionMethod
  type: String
  description: Is an indication of how the usage point is physically connected or disconnected.
- name: estimatedLoad
  type: CurrentFlow
  description: Estimated load.
- name: grounded
  type: Boolean
  description: True if grounded.
- name: isSdp
  type: Boolean
  description: If true, this usage point is a service delivery point, i.e., a usage point where the ownership of the service
    changes hands.
- name: isVirtual
  type: Boolean
  description: If true, this usage point is virtual, i.e., no physical location exists in the network where a meter could
    be located to collect the meter readings. For example, one may define a virtual usage point to serve as an aggregation
    of usage for all of a company's premises distributed widely across the distribution territory. Otherwise, the usage point
    is physical, i.e., there is a logical point in the network where a meter could be located to collect meter readings.
- name: minimalUsageExpected
  type: Boolean
  description: If true, minimal or zero usage is expected at this usage point for situations such as premises vacancy, logical
    or physical disconnect. It is used for readings validation and estimation.
- name: nominalServiceVoltage
  type: Voltage
  description: Nominal service voltage.
- name: outageRegion
  type: String
  description: Outage region in which this usage point is located.
- name: phaseCode
  type: PhaseCode
  description: Phase code. Number of wires and specific nominal phases can be deduced from enumeration literal values. For
    example, ABCN is three-phase, four-wire, s12n (splitSecondary12N) is single-phase, three-wire, and s1n and s2n are single-phase,
    two-wire.
- name: phaseCount
  type: Integer
  description: Number of potential phases the Usage Point supports, typically 0, 1 or 3.
- name: physicalConnectionCapacity
  type: DecimalQuantity
  description: Quantitative information about the maximum physical capacity of the connection for the usage point.
- name: ratedCurrent
  type: CurrentFlow
  description: Current flow that this usage point is configured to deliver.
- name: ratedPower
  type: ActivePower
  description: Active power that this usage point is configured to deliver.
- name: readCycle
  type: String
  description: Cycle day on which the meter for this usage point will normally be read.  Usually correlated with the billing
    cycle.
- name: readRoute
  type: String
  description: Identifier of the route to which this usage point is assigned for purposes of meter reading. Typically used
    to configure hand held meter reading systems prior to collection of reads.
- name: serviceDeliveryRemark
  type: String
  description: Remarks about this usage point, for example the reason for it being rated with a non-nominal priority.
- name: servicePriority
  type: String
  description: Priority of service for this usage point. Note that usage points at the same service location can have different
    priorities.
