name: Shift
description: |-
  Generally referring to a period of operation or work performed. Whether the shift is open/closed can be derived from attributes 'activityInterval.start' and 'activityInterval.end'.
  The grand total for receipts (i.e., cumulative total of all actual receipted amounts during this shift; bankable + non-bankable; excludes rounding error totals) can be derived from receipt:
  =sum('Receipt.receiptAmount'); includes bankable and non-bankable receipts.
  It also has to be reconciled against:
  =sum('receiptsGrandTotalBankable' + 'receiptsGrandTotalNonBankable')
  and against receipt summary:
  =sum('ReceiptSummary.receiptsTotal').
  The attributes with "GrandTotal" defined in this class may need to be used when the source data is periodically flushed from the system and then these cannot be derived.

    Cumulative total of transacted amounts during this shift. Values are obtained from transaction:
