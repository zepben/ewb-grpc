description: |-
  The package contains portions of the model defined byEnterprise Resource Planning (ERP) standards like those proposed by the Open Applications Group (OAG). It is provided to facilitate integration among electric utility applications (CIM) and enterprise resource planning (ERP) applications (as defined by OAG). Rather than inventing new CIM classes that accomplish similar functionality as in existing ERP models, the preferred approach is to use and extend ERP classes as appropriate in other packages.
  If a model other that the OAG standard is used as a basis for ERP integration, the utility classes labeld "Erp..." should be associated with the appropriate classes of that standard. In fact, definitions of "Erp..." classes are based on OAG Nouns to facilitate this process.

  TODO: The following has been copied from a very old version of draft Part 11, so the references are wrong, but we store the knowledge here to reuse later:
