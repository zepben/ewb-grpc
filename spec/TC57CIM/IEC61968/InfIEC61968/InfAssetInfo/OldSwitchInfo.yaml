description: Properties of switch assets.
attributes:
- name: dielectricStrength
  type: Voltage
  description: The maximum rms voltage that may be applied across an open contact without breaking down the dielectric properties
    of the switch in the open position.
- name: loadBreak
  type: Boolean
  description: True if switch has load breaking capabiity. Unless specified false, this is always assumed to be true for breakers
    and reclosers.
- name: makingCapacity
  type: CurrentFlow
  description: The highest value of current the switch can make at the rated voltage under specified operating conditions
    without suffering significant deterioration of its performance.
- name: minimumCurrent
  type: CurrentFlow
  description: The lowest value of current that the switch can make, carry and break in uninterrupted duty at the rated voltage
    under specified operating conditions without suffering significant deterioration of its performance.
- name: poleCount
  type: Integer
  description: Number of poles (i.e. of current carrying conductors that are switched).
- name: remote
  type: Boolean
  description: ' True if device is capable of being operated by remote control.'
- name: withstandCurrent
  type: CurrentFlow
  description: The highest value of current the switch can carry in the closed position at the rated voltage under specified
    operating conditions without suffering significant deterioration of its performance.
