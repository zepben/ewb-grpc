name: AssetAnalog
description: Definition of type of analog useful in asset domain.
attributes:
- name: detectionLimit
  type: Float
  description: Detection limit of related analog value if different from detection limit of test standard or if there is no
    test standard. The detection limit (also known as lower limit of detection or limit of detection (LOD), is the lowest
    quantity of a substance that can be distinguished from the absence of that substance (a blank value) within a stated confidence
    limit (generally 1%).
- name: precision
  type: Float
  description: Precision of related analog value if different from precision of test standard or if there is no test standard.
    Precision is a measure of how closely individual measurements agree with one another. Expressed as 'plus or minus' the
    value of this attribute.
- name: reportingTemperature
  type: Temperature
  description: Reporting temperature of related analog value if different from reporting temperature of test standard or if
    there is no test standard. Reporting temperature is what gas volumes are normalized to. Different reporting temperatures
    are used by different sources. For example, ASTM specifies 0°C, whereas IEC specifies 20°C. Online monitors often have
    their own unique reporting temperatures.
