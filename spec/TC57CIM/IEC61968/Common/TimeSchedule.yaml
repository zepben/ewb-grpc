    interval meter that is set up for five minute intervals ('recurrencePeriod'=300=5 min), setting 'offset'=120=2 min would
    result in scheduled events to read the meter executing at 2 min, 7 min, 12 min, 17 min, 22 min, 27 min, 32 min, 37 min,
    42 min, 47 min, 52 min, and 57 min past each hour.

- name: recurrencePeriod
  type: Seconds
  description: Duration between time points, from the beginning of one period to the beginning of the next period. Note that
