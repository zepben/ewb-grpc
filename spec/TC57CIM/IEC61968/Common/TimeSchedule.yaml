  type: Seconds
  description: The offset from midnight (i.e., 0 h, 0 min, 0 s) for the periodic time points to begin. For example, for an
    interval meter that is set up for five minute intervals ('recurrencePeriod'=300=5 min), setting 'offset'=120=2 min would
    result in scheduled events to read the meter executing at 2 min, 7 min, 12 min, 17 min, 22 min, 27 min, 32 min, 37 min,
    42 min, 47 min, 52 min, and 57 min past each hour.

  type: String
  description: Interval at which the scheduled action repeats (e.g., first Monday of every month, last day of the month, etc.).
- name: recurrencePeriod
  type: Seconds
  description: Duration between time points, from the beginning of one period to the beginning of the next period. Note that
    a device like a meter may have multiple interval periods (e.g., 1 min, 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, or 60 min).
