name: Outage
description: |-
  Document describing details of an active or planned outage in a part of the electrical network.
  A non-planned outage may be created upon:
  - a breaker trip,
  - a fault indicator status change,
  - a meter event indicating customer outage,
  - a reception of one or more customer trouble calls, or
  - an operator command, reflecting information obtained from the field crew.
  Outage restoration may be performed using a switching plan which complements the outage information with detailed switching activities, including the relationship to the crew and work.
  A planned outage may be created upon:
  - a request for service, maintenance or construction work in the field, or
  - an operator-defined outage for what-if/contingency network analysis.
