description: |-
  This package and its subpackages contain informative (unstable) elements of the model, expected to evolve a lot or to be removed, and not published as IEC document yet. Some portions of it will be reworked and moved to normative packages as the need arises, and some portions may be removed.
  WG13 does not generate documentation for this informative portion of the model.
