description: The type of alternate model frame.  For example, it could be generator group used to represent generators in
  state estimator, planning, planning dynamics, short circuit, or real-time dynamics etc., but does not specifically represent
  any one alternative model. This need to know what objects to be removed in the realization of any one alternate model.
