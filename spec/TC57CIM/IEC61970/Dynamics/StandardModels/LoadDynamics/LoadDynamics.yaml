  Load whose behaviour is described by reference to a standard model <font color="#0f0f0f">or by definition of a user-defined model.</font>
  A standard feature of dynamic load behaviour modelling is the ability to associate the same behaviour to multiple energy consumers by means of a single load definition.  The load model is always applied to individual bus loads (energy consumers).
