name: AsynchronousMachineDynamics
description: "Asynchronous machine whose behaviour is described by reference to a standard model expressed in either time\
  \ constant reactance form or equivalent circuit form <font color=\"#0f0f0f\">or by definition of a user-defined model.</font>\n\
  Parameter details:\n<ol>\n\t<li>Asynchronous machine parameters such as <i>Xl, Xs,</i> etc. are actually used as inductances\
  \ in the model, but are commonly referred to as reactances since, at nominal frequency, the PU values are the same. However,\
  \ some references use the symbol <i>L</i> instead of <i>X</i>.</li>\n</ol>"
