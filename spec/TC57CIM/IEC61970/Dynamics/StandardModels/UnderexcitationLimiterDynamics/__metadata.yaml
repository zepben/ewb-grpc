name: UnderexcitationLimiterDynamics
description: Underexcitation limiters (UELs) act to boost excitation. The UEL typically senses either a combination of voltage
  and current of the synchronous machine or a combination of real and reactive power. Some UELs utilize a temperature or pressure
  recalibration feature, in which the UEL characteristic is shifted depending upon the generator cooling gas temperature or
  pressure.
