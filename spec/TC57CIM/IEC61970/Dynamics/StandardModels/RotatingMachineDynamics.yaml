name: RotatingMachineDynamics
description: Abstract parent class for all synchronous and asynchronous machine standard models.
attributes:
- name: damping
  type: Float
  description: Damping torque coefficient (<i>D</i>) (&gt;= 0).  A proportionality constant that, when multiplied by the angular
    velocity of the rotor poles with respect to the magnetic field (frequency), results in the damping torque.  This value
    is often zero when the sources of damping torques (generator damper windings, load damping effects, etc.) are modelled
    in detail.  Typical value = 0.
- name: inertia
  type: Seconds
  description: Inertia constant of generator or motor and mechanical load (<i>H</i>) (&gt; 0).  This is the specification
    for the stored energy in the rotating mass when operating at rated speed.  For a generator, this includes the generator
    plus all other elements (turbine, exciter) on the same shaft and has units of MW x s.  For a motor, it includes the motor
    plus its mechanical load. Conventional units are PU on the generator MVA base, usually expressed as MW x s / MVA or just
    s. This value is used in the accelerating power reference frame for operator training simulator solutions.  Typical value
    = 3.
- name: saturationFactor
  type: Float
  description: Saturation factor at rated terminal voltage (<i>S1</i>) (&gt;= 0).  Not used by simplified model.  Defined
    by defined by <i>S</i>(<i>E1</i>) in the SynchronousMachineSaturationParameters diagram.  Typical value = 0,02.
- name: saturationFactor120
  type: Float
  description: Saturation factor at 120% of rated terminal voltage (<i>S12</i>) (&gt;= RotatingMachineDynamics.saturationFactor).
    Not used by the simplified model, defined by <i>S</i>(<i>E2</i>) in the SynchronousMachineSaturationParameters diagram.  Typical
    value = 0,12.
- name: statorLeakageReactance
  type: PU
  description: Stator leakage reactance (<i>Xl</i>) (&gt;= 0). Typical value = 0,15.
- name: statorResistance
  type: PU
  description: Stator (armature) resistance (<i>Rs</i>) (&gt;= 0). Typical value = 0,005.
