name: OverexcitationLimiterDynamics
description: Overexcitation limiters (OELs) are also referred to as <i>maximum excitation limiters </i>and <i>field current
  limiters. </i>The possibility of voltage collapse in stressed power systems increases the importance of modelling these
  limiters in studies of system conditions that cause machines to operate at high levels of excitation for a sustained period,
  such as voltage collapse or system-islanding. Such events typically occur over a long time frame compared with transient
  or small-signal stability simulations.
