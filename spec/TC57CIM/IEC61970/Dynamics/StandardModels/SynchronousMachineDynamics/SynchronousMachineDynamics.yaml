description: "Synchronous machine whose behaviour is described by reference to a standard model expressed in one of the following\
  \ forms:\n- simplified (or classical), where a group of generators or motors is not modelled in detail;\n- detailed, in\
  \ equivalent circuit form;\n- detailed, in time constant reactance form; or\n<font color=\"#0f0f0f\">- by definition of\
  \ a user-defined model.</font>\n<font color=\"#0f0f0f\">It is a common practice to represent small generators by a negative\
  \ load rather than by a dynamic generator model when performing dynamics simulations. In this case, a SynchronousMachine\
  \ in the static model is not represented by anything in the dynamics model, instead it is treated as an ordinary load.</font>\n\
  <font color=\"#0f0f0f\">Parameter details:</font>\n<ol>\n\t<li><font color=\"#0f0f0f\">Synchronous machine parameters such\
  \ as <i>Xl, Xd, Xp</i> etc. are actually used as inductances in the models,</font> but are commonly referred to as reactances\
  \ since, at nominal frequency, the PU values are the same. However, some references use the symbol <i>L</i> instead of <i>X</i>.</li>\n\
