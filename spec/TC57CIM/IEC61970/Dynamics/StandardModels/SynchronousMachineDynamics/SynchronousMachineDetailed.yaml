name: SynchronousMachineDetailed
description: "All synchronous machine detailed types use a subset of the same data parameters and input/output variables.\
  \  \nThe several variations differ in the following ways:\n- the number of  equivalent windings that are included;\n- the\
  \ way in which saturation is incorporated into the model;\n- whether or not “subtransient saliency” (<i>X''q</i> not = <i>X''d</i>)\
  \ is represented.\nIt is not necessary for each simulation tool to have separate models for each of the model types.  The\
  \ same model can often be used for several types by alternative logic within the model.  Also, differences in saturation\
  \ representation might not result in significant model performance differences so model substitutions are often acceptable."
attributes:
- name: efdBaseRatio
  type: Float
  description: Ratio (exciter voltage/generator voltage) of <i>Efd</i> bases of exciter and generator models (&gt; 0). Typical
    value = 1.
- name: ifdBaseType
  type: IfdBaseKind
  description: 'Excitation base system mode. It should be equal to the value of <i>WLMDV</i> given by the user. <i>WLMDV</i>
    is the PU ratio between the field voltage and the excitation current: <i>Efd</i> = <i>WLMDV</i> x <i>Ifd</i>. Typical
    value = ifag.'
