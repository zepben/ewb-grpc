name: OperationalLimit
description: "A value and normal value associated with a specific kind of limit. \nThe sub class value and normalValue attributes\
  \ vary inversely to the associated OperationalLimitType.acceptableDuration (acceptableDuration for short).  \nIf a particular\
  \ piece of equipment has multiple operational limits of the same kind (apparent power, current, etc.), the limit with the\
  \ greatest acceptableDuration shall have the smallest limit value and the limit with the smallest acceptableDuration shall\
  \ have the largest limit value.  Note: A large current can only be allowed to flow through a piece of equipment for a short\
  \ duration without causing damage, but a lesser current can be allowed to flow for a longer duration."
