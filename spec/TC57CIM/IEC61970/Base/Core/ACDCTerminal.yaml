name: ACDCTerminal
description: An electrical connection point (AC or DC) to a piece of conducting equipment. Terminals are connected at physical
  connection points called connectivity nodes.
attributes:
- name: connected
  type: Boolean
  description: "The connected status is related to a bus-branch model and the topological node to terminal relation.  True\
    \ implies the terminal is connected to the related topological node and false implies it is not. \nIn a bus-branch model,\
    \ the connected status is used to tell if equipment is disconnected without having to change the connectivity described\
    \ by the topological node to terminal relation. A valid case is that conducting equipment can be connected in one end\
    \ and open in the other. In particular for an AC line segment, where the reactive line charging can be significant, this\
    \ is a relevant case."
- name: sequenceNumber
  type: Integer
  description: The orientation of the terminal connections for a multiple terminal conducting equipment.  The sequence numbering
    starts with 1 and additional terminals should follow in increasing order.   The first terminal is the "starting point"
    for a two terminal branch.
