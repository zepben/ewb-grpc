name: Terminal
description: An AC electrical connection point to a piece of conducting equipment. Terminals are connected at physical connection
  points called connectivity nodes.
attributes:
- name: phases
  type: PhaseCode
  description: |-
    Represents the normal network phasing condition. If the attribute is missing, three phases (ABC) shall be assumed, except for terminals of grounding classes (specializations of EarthFaultCompensator, GroundDisconnector, GroundSwitch, and Ground) which will be assumed to be N. Therefore, phase code ABCN is explicitly declared when needed, e.g. for star point grounding equipment.
    The phase code on terminals connecting same ConnectivityNode or same TopologicalNode as well as for equipment between two terminals shall be consistent.

associations:
- source: Terminal
  target: TopologicalNode
  sourceCardinality: 0..*
  sourceName: Terminal
  sourceDescription: The terminals associated with the topological node.   This can be used as an alternative to the connectivity
    node path to terminal, thus making it unnecessary to model connectivity nodes in some cases.   Note that if connectivity
    nodes are in the model, this association would probably not be used as an input specification.
  targetCardinality: 0..1
  targetName: TopologicalNode
  targetDescription: The topological node associated with the terminal.   This can be used as an alternative to the connectivity
    node path to topological node, thus making it unnecessary to model connectivity nodes in some cases.   Note that the if
    connectivity nodes are in the model, this association would probably not be used as an input specification.
