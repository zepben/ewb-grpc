name: Equipment
description: The parts of a power system that are physical devices, electronic or mechanical.
attributes:
- name: inService
  type: Boolean
  description: Specifies the availability of the equipment. True means the equipment is available for topology processing,
    which determines if the equipment is energized or not. False means that the equipment is treated by network applications
    as if it is not in the model.
- name: normallyInService
  type: Boolean
  description: Specifies the availability of the equipment under normal operating conditions. True means the equipment is
    available for topology processing, which determines if the equipment is energized or not. False means that the equipment
    is treated by network applications as if it is not in the model.
- name: aggregate
  type: Boolean
  description: "The aggregate flag provides an alternative way of representing an aggregated (equivalent) element. It is applicable\
    \ in cases when the dedicated classes for equivalent equipment do not have all of the attributes necessary to represent\
    \ the required level of detail.  In case the flag is set to “true” the single instance of equipment represents multiple\
    \ pieces of equipment that have been modelled together as an aggregate equivalent obtained by a network reduction procedure.\
    \ Examples would be power transformers or synchronous machines operating in parallel modelled as a single aggregate power\
    \ transformer or aggregate synchronous machine.  \nThe attribute is not used for EquivalentBranch, EquivalentShunt and\
    \ EquivalentInjection."
- name: networkAnalysisEnabled
  type: Boolean
  description: The equipment is enabled to participate in network analysis.  If unspecified, the value is assumed to be true.
