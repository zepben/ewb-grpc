name: TapChanger
description: Mechanism for changing transformer winding tap positions.
attributes:
- name: highStep
  type: Integer
  description: |-
    Highest possible tap step position, advance from neutral.
    The attribute shall be greater than lowStep.
- name: initialDelay
  type: Seconds
  description: For an LTC, the delay for initial tap changer operation (first step change).
- name: lowStep
  type: Integer
  description: Lowest possible tap step position, retard from neutral.
- name: ltcFlag
  type: Boolean
  description: Specifies whether or not a TapChanger has load tap changing capabilities.
- name: neutralStep
  type: Integer
  description: |-
    The neutral tap step position for this winding.
    The attribute shall be equal to or greater than lowStep and equal or less than highStep.
    It is the step position where the voltage is neutralU when the other terminals of the transformer are at the ratedU.  If there are other tap changers on the transformer those taps are kept constant at their neutralStep.
- name: neutralU
  type: Voltage
  description: |-
    Voltage at which the winding operates at the neutral tap setting. It is the voltage at the terminal of the PowerTransformerEnd associated with the tap changer when all tap changers on the transformer are at their neutralStep position.  Normally neutralU of the tap changer is the same as ratedU of the PowerTransformerEnd, but it can differ in special cases such as when the tapping mechanism is separate from the winding more common on lower voltage transformers.
    This attribute is not relevant for PhaseTapChangerAsymmetrical, PhaseTapChangerSymmetrical and PhaseTapChangerLinear.
- name: normalStep
  type: Integer
  description: |-
    The tap step position used in "normal" network operation for this winding. For a "Fixed" tap changer indicates the current physical tap setting.
    The attribute shall be equal to or greater than lowStep and equal to or less than highStep.
- name: subsequentDelay
  type: Seconds
  description: For an LTC, the delay for subsequent tap changer operation (second and later step changes).
- name: controlEnabled
  type: Boolean
  description: Specifies the regulation status of the equipment.  True is regulating, false is not regulating.
- name: step
  type: Float
  description: |-
    Tap changer position.
    Starting step for a steady state solution. Non integer values are allowed to support continuous tap variables. The reasons for continuous value are to support study cases where no discrete tap changer has yet been designed, a solution where a narrow voltage band forces the tap step to oscillate or to accommodate for a continuous solution as input.
    The attribute shall be equal to or greater than lowStep and equal to or less than highStep.
