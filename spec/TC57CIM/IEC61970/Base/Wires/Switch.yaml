name: Switch
description: A generic device designed to close, or open, or both, one or more electric circuits.  All switches are two terminal
  devices including grounding switches. The ACDCTerminal.connected at the two sides of the switch shall not be considered
  for assessing switch connectivity, i.e. only Switch.open, .normalOpen and .locked are relevant.
attributes:
- name: normalOpen
  type: Boolean
  description: The attribute is used in cases when no Measurement for the status value is present. If the Switch has a status
    measurement the Discrete.normalValue is expected to match with the Switch.normalOpen.
- name: ratedCurrent
  type: CurrentFlow
  description: |-
    The maximum continuous current carrying capacity in amps governed by the device material and construction.
    The attribute shall be a positive value.
- name: retained
  type: Boolean
  description: Branch is retained in the topological solution.  The flow through retained switches will normally be calculated
    in power flow.
- name: switchOnCount
  type: Integer
  description: The switch on count since the switch was last reset or initialized.
- name: switchOnDate
  type: DateTime
  description: The date and time when the switch was last switched on.
- name: open
  type: Boolean
  description: The attribute tells if the switch is considered open when used as input to topology processing.
- name: locked
  type: Boolean
  description: "If true, the switch is locked. The resulting switch state is a combination of locked and Switch.open attributes\
    \ as follows:\n<ul>\n\t<li>locked=true and Switch.open=true. The resulting state is open and locked;</li>\n\t<li>locked=false\
    \ and Switch.open=true. The resulting state is open;</li>\n\t<li>locked=false and Switch.open=false. The resulting state\
    \ is closed.</li>\n</ul>"
