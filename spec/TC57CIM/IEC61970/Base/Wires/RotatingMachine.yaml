name: RotatingMachine
description: A rotating machine which may be used as a generator or motor.
attributes:
- name: ratedPowerFactor
  type: Float
  description: Power factor (nameplate data). It is primarily used for short circuit data exchange according to IEC 60909.
    The attribute cannot be a negative value.
- name: ratedS
  type: ApparentPower
  description: |-
    Nameplate apparent power rating for the unit.
    The attribute shall have a positive value.
- name: ratedU
  type: Voltage
  description: |-
    Rated voltage (nameplate data, Ur in IEC 60909-0). It is primarily used for short circuit data exchange according to IEC 60909.
    The attribute shall be a positive value.
