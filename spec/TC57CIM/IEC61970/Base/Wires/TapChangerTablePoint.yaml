    The magnetizing branch susceptance deviation as a percentage of nominal value. The actual susceptance is calculated as follows:
    calculated magnetizing susceptance = b(nominal) * (1 + b(from this class)/100).   The b(nominal) is defined as the static magnetizing susceptance on the associated power transformer end or ends.  This model assumes the star impedance (pi model) form.
- name: g
  type: PerCent
  description: |-
    The magnetizing branch conductance deviation as a percentage of nominal value. The actual conductance is calculated as follows:
    calculated magnetizing conductance = g(nominal) * (1 + g(from this class)/100).   The g(nominal) is defined as the static magnetizing conductance on the associated power transformer end or ends.  This model assumes the star impedance (pi model) form.
- name: r
  type: PerCent
  description: |-
    The resistance deviation as a percentage of nominal value. The actual reactance is calculated as follows:
    calculated resistance = r(nominal) * (1 + r(from this class)/100).   The r(nominal) is defined as the static resistance on the associated power transformer end or ends.  This model assumes the star impedance (pi model) form.
- name: ratio
  type: Float
  description: |-
    The voltage at the tap step divided by rated voltage of the transformer end having the tap changer. Hence this is a value close to one.
    For example, if the ratio at step 1 is 1.01, and the rated voltage of the transformer end is 110kV, then the voltage obtained by setting the tap changer to step 1 to is 111.1kV.
- name: step
  type: Integer
  description: The tap step.
- name: x
  type: PerCent
  description: |-
    The series reactance deviation as a percentage of nominal value. The actual reactance is calculated as follows:
    calculated reactance = x(nominal) * (1 + x(from this class)/100).   The x(nominal) is defined as the static series reactance on the associated power transformer end or ends.  This model assumes the star impedance (pi model) form.
