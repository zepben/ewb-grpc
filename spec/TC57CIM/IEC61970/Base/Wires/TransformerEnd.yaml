name: TransformerEnd
description: A conducting connection point of a power transformer. It corresponds to a physical transformer winding terminal.  In
  earlier CIM versions, the TransformerWinding class served a similar purpose, but this class is more flexible because it
  associates to terminal but is not a specialization of ConductingEquipment.
attributes:
- name: bmagSat
  type: PerCent
  description: Core shunt magnetizing susceptance in the saturation region.
- name: endNumber
  type: Integer
  description: Number for this transformer end, corresponding to the end's order in the power transformer vector group or
    phase angle clock number.  Highest voltage winding should be 1.  Each end within a power transformer should have a unique
    subsequent end number.   Note the transformer end number need not match the terminal sequence number.
- name: grounded
  type: Boolean
  description: (for Yn and Zn connections) True if the neutral is solidly grounded.
- name: magBaseU
  type: Voltage
  description: The reference voltage at which the magnetizing saturation measurements were made.
- name: magSatFlux
  type: PerCent
  description: Core magnetizing saturation curve knee flux level.
- name: rground
  type: Resistance
  description: (for Yn and Zn connections) Resistance part of neutral impedance where 'grounded' is true.
- name: xground
  type: Reactance
  description: (for Yn and Zn connections) Reactive part of neutral impedance where 'grounded' is true.
