name: PhaseTapChangerNonLinear
description: The non-linear phase tap changer describes the non-linear behaviour of a phase tap changer. This is a base class
  for the symmetrical and asymmetrical phase tap changer models. The details of these models can be found in IEC 61970-301.
attributes:
- name: voltageStepIncrement
  type: PerCent
  description: |-
    The voltage step increment on the out of phase winding (the PowerTransformerEnd where the TapChanger is located) specified in percent of rated voltage of the PowerTransformerEnd. A positive value means a positive voltage variation from the Terminal at the PowerTransformerEnd, where the TapChanger is located, into the transformer.
    When the increment is negative, the voltage decreases when the tap step increases.
- name: xMax
  type: Reactance
  description: The reactance depends on the tap position according to a "u" shaped curve. The maximum reactance (xMax) appears
    at the low and high tap positions. Depending on the “u” curve the attribute can be either higher or lower than PowerTransformerEnd.x.
- name: xMin
  type: Reactance
  description: The reactance depend on the tap position according to a "u" shaped curve. The minimum reactance (xMin) appear
    at the mid tap position.   PowerTransformerEnd.x shall be consistent with PhaseTapChangerLinear.xMin and PhaseTapChangerNonLinear.xMin.
    In case of inconsistency, PowerTransformerEnd.x shall be used.
