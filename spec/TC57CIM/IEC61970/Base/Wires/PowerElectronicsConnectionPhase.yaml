attributes:
- name: p
  type: ActivePower
  description: Active power injection. Load sign convention is used, i.e. positive sign means flow into the equipment from
    the network.
- name: q
  type: ReactivePower

    the network.
- name: phase
  type: SinglePhaseKind
  description: Phase of this energy producer component.   If the energy producer is wye connected, the connection is from
    the indicated phase to the central ground or neutral point.  If the energy producer is delta connected, the phase indicates
    an energy producer connected from the indicated phase to the next logical non-neutral phase.
