name: Clamp
description: "A Clamp is a galvanic connection at a line segment where other equipment is connected. A Clamp does not cut\
  \ the line segment. \nA Clamp is ConductingEquipment and has one Terminal with an associated ConnectivityNode. Any other\
  \ ConductingEquipment can be connected to the Clamp ConnectivityNode."
attributes:
- name: lengthFromTerminal1
  type: Length
  description: The length to the place where the clamp is located starting from side one of the line segment, i.e. the line
    segment terminal with sequence number equal to 1.
