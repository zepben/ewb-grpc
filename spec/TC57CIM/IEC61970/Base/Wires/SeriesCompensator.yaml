- name: varistorPresent
  type: Boolean
  description: Describe if a metal oxide varistor (mov) for over voltage protection is configured in parallel with the series
    compensator. It is used for short circuit calculations.
- name: varistorRatedCurrent

  description: |-
    The maximum current the varistor is designed to handle at specified duration. It is used for short circuit calculations and exchanged only if SeriesCompensator.varistorPresent is true.
    The attribute shall be a positive value.
- name: varistorVoltageThreshold
  type: Voltage
  description: The dc voltage at which the varistor starts conducting. It is used for short circuit calculations and exchanged
    only if SeriesCompensator.varistorPresent is true.
