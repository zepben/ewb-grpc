name: EnergySourcePhase
description: Represents the single phase information of an unbalanced energy source.
attributes:
- name: phase
  type: SinglePhaseKind
  description: Phase of this energy source component.   If the energy source wye connected, the connection is from the indicated
    phase to the central ground or neutral point.  If the energy source is delta connected, the phase indicates an energy
    source connected from the indicated phase to the next logical non-neutral phase.
