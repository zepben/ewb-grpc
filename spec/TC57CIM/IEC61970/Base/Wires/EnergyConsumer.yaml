name: EnergyConsumer
description: |-
  Generic user of energy - a  point of consumption on the power system model.
  EnergyConsumer.pfixed, .qfixed, .pfixedPct and .qfixedPct have meaning only if there is no LoadResponseCharacteristic associated with EnergyConsumer or if LoadResponseCharacteristic.exponentModel is set to False.
attributes:
- name: customerCount
  type: Integer
  description: Number of individual customers represented by this demand.
- name: grounded
  type: Boolean
  description: Used for Yn and Zn connections. True if the neutral is solidly grounded.
- name: pfixed
  type: ActivePower
  description: Active power of the load that is a fixed quantity and does not vary as load group value varies. Load sign convention
    is used, i.e. positive sign means flow out from a node.
- name: pfixedPct
  type: PerCent
  description: Fixed active power as a percentage of load group fixed active power. Used to represent the time-varying components.  Load
    sign convention is used, i.e. positive sign means flow out from a node.
- name: phaseConnection
  type: PhaseShuntConnectionKind
  description: The type of phase connection, such as wye or delta.
- name: qfixed
  type: ReactivePower
  description: Reactive power of the load that is a fixed quantity and does not vary as load group value varies. Load sign
    convention is used, i.e. positive sign means flow out from a node.
- name: qfixedPct
  type: PerCent
  description: Fixed reactive power as a percentage of load group fixed reactive power. Used to represent the time-varying
    components.  Load sign convention is used, i.e. positive sign means flow out from a node.
- name: p
  type: ActivePower
  description: |-
    Active power of the load. Load sign convention is used, i.e. positive sign means flow out from a node.
    For voltage dependent loads the value is at rated voltage.
    Starting value for a steady state solution.
- name: q
  type: ReactivePower
  description: |-
    Reactive power of the load. Load sign convention is used, i.e. positive sign means flow out from a node.
    For voltage dependent loads the value is at rated voltage.
