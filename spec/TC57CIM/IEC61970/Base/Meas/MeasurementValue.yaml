name: MeasurementValue
description: The current state for a measurement. A state value is an instance of a measurement from a specific source. Measurements
  can be associated with many state values, each representing a different source for the measurement.
attributes:
- name: sensorAccuracy
  type: PerCent
  description: The limit, expressed as a percentage of the sensor maximum, that errors will not exceed when the sensor is
    used under  reference conditions.
- name: timeStamp
  type: DateTime
  description: The time when the value was last updated.
