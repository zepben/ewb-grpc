name: Analog
description: Analog represents an analog Measurement.
attributes:
- name: maxValue
  type: Float
  description: Normal value range maximum for any of the MeasurementValue.values. Used for scaling, e.g. in bar graphs or
    of telemetered raw values.
- name: minValue
  type: Float
  description: Normal value range minimum for any of the MeasurementValue.values. Used for scaling, e.g. in bar graphs or
    of telemetered raw values.
- name: normalValue
  type: Float
  description: Normal measurement value, e.g., used for percentage calculations.
- name: positiveFlowIn
  type: Boolean
  description: If true then this measurement is an active power, reactive power or current with the convention that a positive
    value measured at the Terminal means power is flowing into the related PowerSystemResource.
