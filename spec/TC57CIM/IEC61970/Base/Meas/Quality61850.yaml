name: Quality61850
description: Quality flags in this class are as defined in IEC 61850, except for estimatorReplaced, which has been included
  in this class for convenience.
attributes:
- name: badReference
  type: Boolean
  description: Measurement value may be incorrect due to a reference being out of calibration.
- name: estimatorReplaced
  type: Boolean
  description: Value has been replaced by State Estimator. estimatorReplaced is not an IEC61850 quality bit but has been put
    in this class for convenience.
- name: failure
  type: Boolean
  description: This identifier indicates that a supervision function has detected an internal or external failure, e.g. communication
    failure.
- name: oldData
  type: Boolean
  description: Measurement value is old and possibly invalid, as it has not been successfully updated during a specified time
    interval.
- name: operatorBlocked
  type: Boolean
  description: Measurement value is blocked and hence unavailable for transmission.
- name: oscillatory
  type: Boolean
  description: To prevent some overload of the communication it is sensible to detect and suppress oscillating (fast changing)
    binary inputs. If a signal changes in a defined time twice in the same direction (from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0) then oscillation
    is detected and the detail quality identifier "oscillatory" is set. If it is detected a configured numbers of transient
    changes could be passed by. In this time the validity status "questionable" is set. If after this defined numbers of changes
    the signal is still in the oscillating state the value shall be set either to the opposite state of the previous stable
    value or to a defined default value. In this case the validity status "questionable" is reset and "invalid" is set as
    long as the signal is oscillating. If it is configured such that no transient changes should be passed by then the validity
    status "invalid" is set immediately in addition to the detail quality identifier "oscillatory" (used for status information
    only).
- name: outOfRange
  type: Boolean
  description: Measurement value is beyond a predefined range of value.
- name: overFlow
  type: Boolean
  description: Measurement value is beyond the capability of being  represented properly. For example, a counter value overflows
    from maximum count back to a value of zero.
- name: source
  type: Source
  description: Source gives information related to the origin of a value. The value may be acquired from the process, defaulted
    or substituted.
- name: suspect
  type: Boolean
  description: A correlation function has detected that the value is not consistent with other values. Typically set by a
    network State Estimator.
- name: test
  type: Boolean
  description: Measurement value is transmitted for test purposes.
- name: validity
  type: Validity
  description: Validity of the measurement value.
