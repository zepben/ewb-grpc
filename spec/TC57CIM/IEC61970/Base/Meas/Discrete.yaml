name: Discrete
description: Discrete represents a discrete Measurement, i.e. a Measurement representing discrete values, e.g. a Breaker position.
attributes:
- name: maxValue
  type: Integer
  description: Normal value range maximum for any of the MeasurementValue.values. Used for scaling, e.g. in bar graphs or
    of telemetered raw values.
- name: minValue
  type: Integer
  description: Normal value range minimum for any of the MeasurementValue.values. Used for scaling, e.g. in bar graphs or
    of telemetered raw values.
- name: normalValue
  type: Integer
  description: Normal measurement value, e.g., used for percentage calculations.
