name: GeneratingUnit
description: A single or set of synchronous machines for converting mechanical power into alternating-current power. For example,
  individual machines within a set may be defined for scheduling purposes while a single control signal is derived for the
  set. In this case there would be a GeneratingUnit for each member of the set and an additional GeneratingUnit corresponding
  to the set.
