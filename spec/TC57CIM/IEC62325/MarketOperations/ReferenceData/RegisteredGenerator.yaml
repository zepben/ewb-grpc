- name: extremeLongStart
  type: YesNo
  description: Some long-start up time units may need to receive start up instruction before DA market results are available.  Long-Start

    contractual inter-tie commitment that shall be completed by 6 am one-day ahead.  Therefore, there is a need for a process
    to determine the commitment of such resources before the DA market.
