description: Congestion rent is a major, highly volatile charge currently faced by many participants in the LMP-based electrical
  energy markets. For this reason, the ISOs offer congestion revenue rights (CRR), also known as financial transmission rights
  or transmission congestion contracts. These are financial instruments that allow market participants to hedge against congestion
  charges when they schedule their generation, load and bilateral energy transactions.
