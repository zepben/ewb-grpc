name: NoLoadTest
description: No-load test results determine core admittance parameters. They include exciting current and core loss measurements
  from applying voltage to one winding. The excitation may be positive sequence or zero sequence. The test may be repeated
  at different voltages to measure saturation.
attributes:
- name: excitingCurrent
  type: Double
  description: Exciting current in percent measured from a positive-sequence or single-phase excitation test. Values should be between 0 and 1.
- name: excitingCurrentZero
  type: Double
  description: Exciting current in percent measured from a zero-sequence open-circuit excitation test. Values should be between 0 and 1.
- name: loss
  type: Integer
  description: Losses measured from a positive-sequence or single-phase excitation test in watts.
- name: lossZero
  type: Integer
  description: Losses measured from a zero-sequence excitation test in watts.
- name: energisedEndVoltage
  type: Double
  description: Voltage applied to the winding (end) during test in volts.
