name: TapChangerControl
description: Describes behaviour specific to tap changers, e.g. how the voltage at the end of a line varies with the load
  level and compensation of the voltage drop by tap adjustment.
attributes:
- name: limitVoltage
  type: Double
  nullable: true
  description: Maximum allowed regulated voltage in volts on the PT secondary, regardless of line drop compensation. Sometimes referred
    to as first-house protection.
- name: lineDropCompensation
  type: Boolean
  nullable: true
  description: If true, the line drop compensation is to be applied.
- name: lineDropR
  type: Double
  nullable: true
  description: Line drop compensator resistance setting in ohms for normal (forward) power flow.
- name: lineDropX
  type: Double
  nullable: true
  description: Line drop compensator reactance setting in ohms for normal (forward) power flow.
- name: reverseLineDropR
  type: Double
  nullable: true
  description: Line drop compensator resistance setting in ohms for reverse power flow.
- name: reverseLineDropX
  type: Double
  nullable: true
  description: Line drop compensator reactance setting in ohms for reverse power flow.
- name: forwardLDCBlocking
  type: Boolean
  nullable: true
  description: True implies this tap changer turns off/ignores reverse current flows for line drop compensation when power
    flow is reversed and no reverse line drop is set.
- name: timeDelay
  type: Double
  nullable: true
  description: The time delay for the tap changer in seconds.
- name: coGenerationEnabled
  type: Boolean
  nullable: true
  description: True implies cogeneration mode is enabled and that the control will regulate to the new source bushing (downline
    bushing), keeping locations downline from experiencing overvoltage situations.
