name: EnergySource
description: A generic equivalent for an energy supplier on a transmission or distribution voltage level.
attributes:
- name: activePower
  type: Integer
  description: |-
    High voltage source active injection in watts. Load sign convention is used, i.e. positive sign means flow out from a node.
    Starting value for steady state solutions.
- name: reactivePower
  type: Double
  description: |-
    High voltage source reactive injection in volt-amperes reactive. Load sign convention is used, i.e. positive sign means flow out from a node.
    Starting value for steady state solutions.
- name: voltageAngle
  type: Double
  description: Phase angle in degrees of a-phase open circuit used when voltage characteristics need to be imposed at the node associated
    with the terminal of the energy source, such as when voltages and angles from the transmission level are used as input
    to the distribution network. The attribute shall be a positive value or zero.
- name: voltageMagnitude
  type: Double
  description: Phase-to-phase open circuit voltage magnitude used when voltage characteristics need to be imposed at the node
    associated with the terminal of the energy source, such as when voltages and angles from the transmission level are used
    as input to the distribution network. The attribute shall be a positive value or zero.
- name: r
  type: Double
  description: Positive sequence Thevenin resistance in ohms.
- name: x
  type: Double
  description: Positive sequence Thevenin reactance in ohms.
- name: pMax
  type: Integer
  description: This is the maximum active power in watts that can be produced by the source. Load sign convention is used, i.e. positive
    sign means flow out from a TopologicalNode (bus) into the conducting equipment.
- name: pMin
  type: Integer
  description: This is the minimum active power in watts that can be produced by the source. Load sign convention is used, i.e. positive
    sign means flow out from a TopologicalNode (bus) into the conducting equipment.
