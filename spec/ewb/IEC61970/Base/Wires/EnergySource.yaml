  nullable: true
  description: |-
    High voltage source reactive injection in volt-amperes reactive. Load sign convention is used, i.e. positive sign means flow out from a node.

- name: voltageAngle
  type: Double
  nullable: true
  description: Phase angle in degrees of a-phase open circuit used when voltage characteristics need to be imposed at the node associated
    with the terminal of the energy source, such as when voltages and angles from the transmission level are used as input
    to the distribution network. The attribute shall be a positive value or zero.
- name: voltageMagnitude
  type: Double
  nullable: true
  description: Phase-to-phase open circuit voltage magnitude used when voltage characteristics need to be imposed at the node
    associated with the terminal of the energy source, such as when voltages and angles from the transmission level are used
