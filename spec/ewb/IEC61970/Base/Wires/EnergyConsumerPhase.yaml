name: EnergyConsumerPhase
description: A single phase of an energy consumer.
attributes:
- name: p
  type: ActivePower
  description: |-
    Active power of the load. Load sign convention is used, i.e. positive sign means flow out from a node.
    For voltage dependent loads the value is at rated voltage.
    Starting value for a steady state solution.

- name: qfixed
  type: ReactivePower
  description: Reactive power of the load that is a fixed quantity. Load sign convention is used, i.e. positive sign means
    flow out from a node.
- name: phase
  type: SinglePhaseKind
  description: Phase of this energy consumer component.   If the energy consumer is wye connected, the connection is from
    the indicated phase to the central ground or neutral point.  If the energy consumer is delta connected, the phase indicates
    an energy consumer connected from the indicated phase to the next logical non-neutral phase.
