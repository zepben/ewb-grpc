name: ShuntCompensator
description: A shunt capacitor or reactor or switchable bank of shunt capacitors or reactors. A section of a shunt compensator
  is an individual capacitor or reactor.  A negative value for reactivePerSection indicates that the compensator is a reactor.
  ShuntCompensator is a single terminal device.  Ground is implied.

  description: "Shunt compensator sections in use. Starting value for steady state solution. The attribute shall be a positive\
    \ value or zero. Non integer values are allowed to support continuous variables. The reasons for continuous value are\
    \ to support study cases where no discrete shunt compensators has yet been designed, a solutions where a narrow voltage\
    \ band force the sections to oscillate or accommodate for a continuous solution as input. \nFor LinearShuntConpensator\
    \ the value shall be between zero and ShuntCompensator.maximumSections. At value zero the shunt compensator conductance\
    \ and admittance is zero. Linear interpolation of conductance and admittance between the previous and next integer section\
    \ is applied in case of non-integer values.\nFor NonlinearShuntCompensator-s shall only be set to one of the NonlinearShuntCompenstorPoint.sectionNumber.\
    \ There is no interpolation between NonlinearShuntCompenstorPoint-s."
- name: grounded
  type: Boolean
  nullable: true
  description: Used for Yn and Zn connections. True if the neutral is solidly grounded.
- name: nomU
  type: Double
  nullable: true
  description: The voltage (in volts) at which the nominal reactive power may be calculated. This should normally be within 10% of the
    voltage at which the capacitor is connected to the network.
- name: phaseConnection
  type: PhaseShuntConnectionKind
  nullable: false
  description: The type of phase connection, such as wye or delta.
