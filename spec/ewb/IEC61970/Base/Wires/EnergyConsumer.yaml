name: EnergyConsumer
description: |-
  Generic user of energy - a  point of consumption on the power system model.
  EnergyConsumer.pfixed, .qfixed, .pfixedPct and .qfixedPct have meaning only if there is no LoadResponseCharacteristic associated with EnergyConsumer or if LoadResponseCharacteristic.exponentModel is set to False.
attributes:
- name: customerCount
  type: Integer
  nullable: true
  description: Number of individual customers represented by this demand.
- name: grounded
  type: Boolean
  nullable: true
  description: Used for Yn and Zn connections. True if the neutral is solidly grounded.
- name: p
  type: Integer
  nullable: true
  description: |-
    Active power of the load in watts. Load sign convention is used, i.e. positive sign means flow out from a node.
    For voltage dependent loads the value is at rated voltage.
    Starting value for a steady state solution.
- name: q
  type: Double
  nullable: true
  description: |-
    Reactive power of the load in volt-amperes reactive. Load sign convention is used, i.e. positive sign means flow out from a node.
    For voltage dependent loads the value is at rated voltage.
    Starting value for a steady state solution.
- name: pfixed
  type: Integer
  nullable: true
  description: Active power of the load in watts that is a fixed quantity and does not vary as load group value varies. Load sign convention
    is used, i.e. positive sign means flow out from a node.

  type: PhaseShuntConnectionKind
  nullable: false
  description: The type of phase connection, such as wye or delta.
