description: "Impedance and conductance matrix element values. \nThe diagonal elements are described by the elements having\
  \ the same toPhase and fromPhase value and the off diagonal elements have different toPhase and fromPhase values.  The matrix\
  \ can also be stored in symmetric lower triangular format using the row and column attributes, which map to ACLineSegmentPhase.sequenceNumber."
