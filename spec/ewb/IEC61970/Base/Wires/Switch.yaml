name: Switch
description: A generic device designed to close, or open, or both, one or more electric circuits.  All switches are two terminal
  devices including grounding switches. The ACDCTerminal.connected at the two sides of the switch shall not be considered
  for assessing switch connectivity, i.e. only Switch.open, .normalOpen and .locked are relevant.
attributes:
- name: normalOpen
  type: Boolean
  nullable: false
  description: The attribute is used in cases when no Measurement for the status value is present. If the Switch has a status
    measurement the Discrete.normalValue is expected to match with the Switch.normalOpen.
- name: open
  type: Boolean
  nullable: false
  description: The attribute tells if the switch is considered open when used as input to topology processing.
- name: ratedCurrent
  type: Double
  nullable: true
  description: The maximum continuous current carrying capacity in amps governed by the device material and construction.
    The attribute shall be a positive value.
