  target: ReactiveCapabilityCurve
  sourceCardinality: 0..1
  sourceName: synchronousMachine
  sourceDescription: The available reactive capability curves for this synchronous machine. The first shall be the default for this SynchronousMachine.
  targetCardinality: 0..*
  targetName: reactiveCapabilityCurves
  targetDescription: Reactive power rating envelope versus the synchronous machine's active power, in both the generating and motoring modes. For each active 
    power value there is a corresponding high and low reactive power limit value. Typically there will be a separate curve for each coolant condition, such as 
    hydrogen pressure. The Y1 axis values represent reactive minimum and the Y2 axis values represent reactive maximum.
