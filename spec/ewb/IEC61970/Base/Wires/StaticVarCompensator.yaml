name: StaticVarCompensator
description: |-
  A facility for providing variable and controllable shunt reactive power. The SVC typically consists of a step-down transformer, filter, thyristor-controlled reactor, and thyristor-switched capacitor arms.

  The SVC may operate in fixed MVar output mode or in voltage control mode. When in voltage control mode, the output of the SVC will be proportional to the deviation of voltage at the controlled bus from the voltage setpoint.  The SVC characteristic slope defines the proportion.  If the voltage at the controlled bus is equal to the voltage setpoint, the SVC MVar output is zero.

  - name: voltageSetPoint
    type: Voltage
    description: The reactive power output of the SVC is proportional to the difference between the voltage at the regulated
      bus and the voltage set-point.  When the regulated bus voltage is equal to the voltage set-point, the reactive power output
      is zero. Must be in volts.

    type: ReactivePower
    description: |-
      Reactive power injection in VAr. Load sign convention is used, i.e. positive sign means flow out from a node.
      Starting value for a steady state solution.
