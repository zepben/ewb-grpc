name: StaticVarCompensator
description: |-
  A facility for providing variable and controllable shunt reactive power.
  The SVC typically consists of a step-down transformer, filter, thyristor-controlled reactor,
  and thyristor-switched capacitor arms. The SVC may operate in fixed MVar output mode or in voltage control mode.
  When in voltage control mode, the output of the SVC will be proportional to the deviation of voltage at the
  controlled bus from the voltage set-point. The SVC characteristic slope defines the proportion.
  If the voltage at the controlled bus is equal to the voltage set-point, the SVC MVar output is zero.

  type: SVCControlMode
  description: SVC control mode.
- name: voltageSetPoint
  type: Integer
  description: The reactive power output of the SVC is proportional to the difference between the voltage at the regulated bus and the voltage setpoint.
    When the regulated bus voltage is equal to the voltage setpoint, the reactive power output is zero.
