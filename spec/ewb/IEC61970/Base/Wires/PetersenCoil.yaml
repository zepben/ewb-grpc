name: PetersenCoil
description: A variable impedance device normally used to offset line charging during single line faults in an ungrounded section of network.
attributes:
- name: xGroundNominal
  type: Double
  description: The nominal reactance. This is the operating point (normally over compensation) that is defined based on the resonance point in the healthy 
    network condition. The impedance is calculated based on nominal voltage divided by position current.
