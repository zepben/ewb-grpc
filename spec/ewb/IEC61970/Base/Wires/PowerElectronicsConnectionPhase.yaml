description: A single phase of a power electronics connection.
attributes:
- name: phase
  type: SinglePhaseKind
  description: Phase of this energy producer component.   If the energy producer is wye connected, the connection is from
    the indicated phase to the central ground or neutral point.  If the energy producer is delta connected, the phase indicates
    an energy producer connected from the indicated phase to the next logical non-neutral phase.
