name: BatteryControlMode
description: \[ZBEX\] Kind of battery control.
attributes:
  - name: UNKNOWN
    description: \[ZBEX\] Unknown control mode.
  - name: peakShaveDischarge
    description: \[ZBEX\] This mode directs the BatteryUnit to discharge as needed to maintain the power level of the monitored element within a defined range
      (specified by targetDeadband) or to keep it at or below the value specified by maxAllowedTargetValue. This mode helps prevent power spikes by discharging
      the BatteryUnit to manage peak demand effectively.
  - name: currentPeakShaveDischarge
    description: \[ZBEX\] This mode directs the BatteryUnit to discharge as needed to maintain the current (in amps) at a monitored element below a specified target. Similar to
      peakShaveDischarge, this mode aims to reduce demand peaks, focusing specifically on current levels to manage capacity and enhance system stability where
      current control is essential.
  - name: following
    description: \[ZBEX\] The control is triggered by time and resets the targetValue property to the present monitored element power.
  - name: support
    description: \[ZBEX\] This is essentially the opposite of peakShave modes. The fleet is dispatched to keep the power in the monitored terminal at or above targetValue.
  - name: schedule
    description: \[ZBEX\] In Schedule mode, a trapezoidal-shaped discharge schedule is specified through Tup (up ramp duration), TFlat (at duration), and Tdn (down ramp duration) properties.
  - name: peakShaveCharge
    description: \[ZBEX\] This mode directs the BatteryUnit to initiate charging when the power level at a monitored element falls below a specified threshold (minAllowedTargetValue).
      This mode supports demand leveling by charging the BatteryUnit during low-demand periods, optimizing overall power management.
  - name: currentPeakShaveCharge
    description: \[ZBEX\] This mode initiates charging when the current (in Amps) at a monitored element falls below a specified threshold (minAllowedTargetValue).
      Similar to peakShaveCharge, this mode aims to manage demand effectively, but it operates based on current levels rather than power, providing finer
      control in systems where current management is prioritized.
  - name: time
    description: \[ZBEX\] In Time mode all storage elements are set to discharge when in the course of simulation the time of day passes the specified hour of day by the
      TimeDisChargeTrigger property (hour is a decimal value, e.g., 10.5 = 1030)
  - name: profile
    description: \[ZBEX\] In this mode both discharging and charging precisely follow a per-unit curve.
