name: PolarizingQuantityType
description: |-
  [ZBEX] Defines the type of polarizing quantity used by the directional relay. This informs how the relay
  determines the reference voltage from the Voltage transformers associated with its parent ProtectionEquipment.
attributes:
- name: UNKNOWN
  description: \[ZBEX\] Type is unknown.
- name: SELF_PHASE_VOLTAGE
  description: \[ZBEX\] Uses the voltage of the same phase as the current element (e.g., Va for an Ia element).
- name: QUADRATURE_VOLTAGE
  description: \[ZBEX\] Uses a quadrature voltage (e.g., Vbc for an Ia element, specific convention applies).
- name: ZERO_SEQUENCE_VOLTAGE
  description: \[ZBEX\] Uses the zero sequence voltage (Vo), derived from three phase voltages.
- name: NEGATIVE_SEQUENCE_VOLTAGE
  description: \[ZBEX\] Uses the negative sequence voltage (V2), derived from three phase voltages.
- name: POSITIVE_SEQUENCE_VOLTAGE
  description: \[ZBEX\] Uses the positive sequence voltage (V1), derived from three phase voltages.
