description: \[ZBEX\] This extension is in-line with the CIM working group for replacing the `protection` package, can
  be replaced when the working group outcome is merged into the CIM model.
  <br/>
  A protective device used in power systems that measures the impedance of a transmission line to
  determine the distance to a fault, and initiates circuit breaker tripping to isolate the faulty section and safeguard
  the power system.
