name: DistanceRelay
description: \[ZBEX\] This extension is in-line with the CIM working group for replacing the `protection` package, can
  be replaced when the working group outcome is merged into the CIM model.
  <br/>
  A protective device used in power systems that measures the impedance of a transmission line to
  determine the distance to a fault, and initiates circuit breaker tripping to isolate the faulty section and safeguard
  the power system.
attributes:
- name: backwardBlind
  type: Impedance
  description: \[ZBEX\] The reverse blind impedance (in ohms) that defines the area to be blinded in the opposite direction of the power flow.
- name: backwardReach
  type: Impedance
  description: \[ZBEX\] The reverse reach impedance (in ohms) that determines the maximum distance along the
    transmission line in the opposite direction of power flow for which the relay will provide protection.
- name: backwardReactance
  type: Reactance
  description: \[ZBEX\] The reverse reactance (in ohms) that determines the maximum distance along the transmission line
    in the opposite direction of power flow for which the relay will provide protection.
- name: forwardBlind
  type: Impedance
  description: \[ZBEX\] The forward blind impedance (in ohms) that defines the area to be blinded in the opposite direction of the power flow.
