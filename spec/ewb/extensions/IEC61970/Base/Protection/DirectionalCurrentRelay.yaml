name: DirectionalCurrentRelay
description: |-
  [ZBEX] A Directional Current Relay is a type of protective relay used in electrical power systems to detect the
  direction of current flow and operate only when the current exceeds a certain threshold in a specified direction.
attributes:
- name: directionalCharacteristicAngle
  type: AngleDegrees
  description: \[ZBEX\] The characteristic angle (in degrees) that defines the boundary between the operate and restrain regions of the directional element, relative to the polarizing quantity. Often referred to as Maximum Torque Angle (MTA) or Relay Characteristic Angle (RCA).
- name: polarizingQuantityType
  type: PolarizingQuantityType
  description: \[ZBEX\] Specifies the type of voltage to be used for polarization. This guides the selection/derivation of voltage from the VTs.
- name: relayElementPhase
  type: PhaseCode
  description: \[ZBEX\] The phase associated with this directional relay element. This helps in selecting the correct 'self-phase' or other phase-derived.
- name: minimumPickupCurrent
  type: CurrentFlow
  description: \[ZBEX\] The minimum current magnitude required for the directional element to operate reliably and determine direction. This might be different from the main pickupCurrent for the overcurrent function.
- name: currentLimit1
  type: CurrentFlow
  description: \[ZBEX\] Current limit number 1 for inverse time pickup in amperes.
- name: inverseTimeFlag
  type: Boolean
  description: \[ZBEX\] Set true if the current relay has inverse time characteristic.
- name: timeDelay1
  type: Seconds
  description: \[ZBEX\] Inverse time delay number 1 for current limit number 1 in seconds.
