/**
 * A cut separates a line segment into two parts. The cut appears as a switch inserted between these two parts and connects them together. As the cut is
 * normally open there is no galvanic connection between the two line segment parts. But it is possible to close the cut to get galvanic connection. The cut
 * terminals are oriented towards the line segment terminals with the same sequence number. Hence the cut terminal with sequence number equal to 1 is oriented
 * to the line segment's terminal with sequence number equal to 1. The cut terminals also act as connection points for jumpers and other equipment, e.g. a
 * mobile generator. To enable this, connectivity nodes are placed at the cut terminals. Once the connectivity nodes are in place any conducting equipment can
 * be connected at them.
