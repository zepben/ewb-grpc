/**
 * A facility for providing variable and controllable shunt reactive power.
 * The SVC typically consists of a step-down transformer, filter, thyristor-controlled reactor,
 * and thyristor-switched capacitor arms. The SVC may operate in fixed MVar output mode or in voltage control mode.
 * When in voltage control mode, the output of the SVC will be proportional to the deviation of voltage at the
 * controlled bus from the voltage set-point. The SVC characteristic slope defines the proportion.
 * If the voltage at the controlled bus is equal to the voltage set-point, the SVC MVar output is zero.
