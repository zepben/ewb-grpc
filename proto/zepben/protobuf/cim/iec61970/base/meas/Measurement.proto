/**
 * A Measurement represents any measured, calculated or non-measured non-calculated quantity. Any piece of equipment may
 * contain Measurements, e.g. a substation may have temperature measurements and door open indications, a transformer may
 * have oil temperature and tank pressure measurements, a bay may contain a number of power flow measurements and a
 * Breaker may contain a switch status measurement.
 * <p>
 * The PSR - Measurement association is intended to capture this use of Measurement and is included in the naming
 * hierarchy based on EquipmentContainer. The naming hierarchy typically has Measurements as leafs,
 * e.g. Substation-VoltageLevel-Bay-Switch-Measurement.
 * <p>
 * Some Measurements represent quantities related to a particular sensor location in the network, e.g. a voltage transformer
 * (PT) at a busbar or a current transformer (CT) at the bar between a breaker and an isolator. The sensing position is not
 * captured in the PSR - Measurement association. Instead it is captured by the Measurement - Terminal association that is
 * used to define the sensing location in the network topology. The location is defined by the connection of the Terminal to
 * ConductingEquipment.
 * <p>
 * If both a Terminal and PSR are associated, and the PSR is of type ConductingEquipment, the associated Terminal should
 * belong to that ConductingEquipment instance.
 * <p>
 * When the sensor location is needed both Measurement-PSR and Measurement-Terminal are used. The Measurement-Terminal
 * association is never used alone.
