/**
 * Type of name. Possible values for attribute 'name' are implementation dependent but standard profiles may specify
 * types. An enterprise may have multiple IT systems each having its own local name for the same object,
 * e.g. a planning system may have different names from an EMS. An object may also have different names within the same
 * IT system, e.g. localName as defined in CIM version 14. The definition from CIM14 is:
 * The localName is a human readable name of the object. It is a free text name local to a node in a naming hierarchy
 * similar to a file directory structure. A power system related naming hierarchy may be: Substation, VoltageLevel,
 * Equipment etc. Children of the same parent in such a hierarchy have names that typically are unique among them.
