/**
 * An unordered enumeration of phase identifiers.  Allows designation of phases for both transmission and distribution equipment,
 * circuits and loads.   The enumeration, by itself, does not describe how the phases are connected together or connected to ground.
 * Ground is not explicitly denoted as a phase.
 * <p>
 * Residential and small commercial loads are often served from single-phase, or split-phase, secondary circuits. For example of s12N,
 * phases 1 and 2 refer to hot wires that are 180 degrees out of phase, while N refers to the neutral wire. Through single-phase
 * transformer connections, these secondary circuits may be served from one or two of the primary phases A, B, and C. For three-phase
 * loads, use the A, B, C phase codes instead of s12N.
