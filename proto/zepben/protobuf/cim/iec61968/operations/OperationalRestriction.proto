/**
 * A document that can be associated with equipment to describe any sort of restrictions compared with the original
 * manufacturer's specification or with the usual operational practice e.g. temporary maximum loadings, maximum
 * switching current, do not operate if bus couplers are open, etc.
 * <p>
 * In the UK, for example, if a breaker or switch ever mal-operates, this is reported centrally and utilities use their
 * asset systems to identify all the installed devices of the same manufacturer's type. They then apply operational
 * restrictions in the operational systems to warn operators of potential problems. After appropriate inspection and
 * maintenance, the operational restrictions may be removed.
